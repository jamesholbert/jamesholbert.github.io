                        <h1>Rules </h1>
                        <p>Centuries have passed since blah blah have fun. With very few exceptions, this tabletop roleplaying game is utterly paperless.</p>
                        <p>This game is designed to be role play heavy, but it doesn't have to be.  In fact, you can just create characters and play against each other if you want.</p> <p>Normally, the GM creates or picks a story, and narrates it as the players who have chosen a character of their own within the story decide how their characters think and react.</p> <h2> Character Creation</h2> <p>Instead of HP, you have dice that you spend 10 character points (CP) on, and gain 1 more CP to spend each time you level up.</p>  <p>You can spend CP on Basic Action dice, then spend more to upgrade them to proficiency dice and skill dice.  Proficiency dice can upgrade to *either* Savvy or Mastery dice. Magic is also purchased with CP.</p> <p>To level up, you need to defeat the equivalent of 20 times your level in CP.  There are no classes, instead, each character picks a vocation.  </p>

<h2> Not dying</h2>

<p>Damage is tracked by the black side of <img style="width: 12px" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.thegamecrafter.com/8c07302f2fce6ff4d84bdb3f1d4c400ff7fd6ee3" /> (Injury Dice) and force you to burn (set aside) your rolled dice. If you have as many indury dice (damage or exhaustion) as your action dice, you pass out. If the whole party passed out, the GM can declare game over, or continue the plot in way that the party survives, such as being captured.

<p><b>When you roll your dice for any reason, you must first burn as many dice as you have damage dice in front of you before you can use any.  You can burn blank rolls.</b></p>

<p>Items are also dice, but not action dice. You never need to burn any.  You roll them whenever you use them (attacking, blocking, etc), NOT when you roll at the beginning of your turn.</p>

<p>When you are healed, damage is converted to exhaustion (the grey side).  Exhaustion still requires you to burn dice, but getting hurt again just converts the exhaustion back to damage.</p>

<p>Remove 1 exhaustion per in game hour, if you don't have any, convert 1 damage to exhaustion.</p>

<p><h4>Example:</h4> Eric Genmage (level 2) originally spent 5 CP on action dice, and upgraded 3 to Intelligence dice, and 2 to proficiency dice.  He then can roll 5 dice per round.  At level 2 he upgrades one of his proficiency die to a Mastery Die. If he takes one damage then he still rolls all 5, but has to burn one before performing any actions.  If he takes 4 more damage, he faints.  </p>

<h2> Turn order:  </h2>
<!-- Melee fighters can't catch up to archers who have more action dice.  Makes sense but feels broken.  Is there a mechanic in place to fix this?  Perhaps if an archer shoots, he can't retreat any further that round?  Maybe any time you attack, you can't retreat the next round?  Should there be levels of range between creatures?

This also might be fixed if the melee fighter has a bow, since they'll have more armor, they may just win.-->

<p><b>Overview</b>: Everyone rolls to begin the first round, then each player takes successive turns within the round (usually more than 1) until the next round begins, or the combat ends.  Each round represents about 10 seconds.</p>

<p><b>Begin:</b> At the beginning of combat, all players roll all their action dice and *can* declare how many successes they have.  The player with the most successes goes first, ties are broken by whoever has the most <img style="width: 10px" src="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/Q/D/C/e/o/0/green-md.png" />, then <img style="width: 10px" src="http://www.iconsdb.com/icons/preview/royal-blue/literature-xxl.png" />, then <img style="width: 10px" src="http://www.clipartbest.com/cliparts/9cR/geG/9cRgeGpKi.png" />.  <!--They then discard any necessary dice for damage/exhaustion. -->

<p><b>Rounds:</b> Active player declares 1 action, spending as many points as they want. If not, they forfeit any more actions; though they can still take reactions by burning a die.[***Playtesting:*** *A creature can burn 1 die per turn to advance to or retreat from melee, but it can be contested by the opposing creature by also burning a die. Creatures cannot retreat from a creature they just attacked.* [can this be completely out of order?]] After the active player's action, the player to the left takes a turn. Keep going clockwise until everyone is out of unused successes, then begin the next round by everyone rolling all their action dice again.  The first player to use all their successes in the former round starts the next round (since they are at a disadvantage having no successes to respond to everyone else's final actions, and logically they'd have the most time to observe and react to the next round).</p>

<p>Any hit deals 1 damage, and each boost adds 1 damage. If a player doesn't defend an attack with a reaction of some kind, they take all damage coming at them.</p>

<p>If a player has armor, they roll the corresponding number of the damage dice coming to them as shown in the chart on page 2.  Any that roll grey are successfully defended by the armor, the black ones stay as damage.  </p>

<p><b>Example:</b> Strigh Bength has Chain mail and takes 4 damage dice in one attack. He takes two of them (the defense number on Chain mail) and rolls them.  He gets one grey and one black. The grey one is removed and he only takes 3 damage total.</p>

<p><b>Reactions:</b> Burn a die to react to someone's action.</p>

<p><b>Used dice, damage dice, and burnt dice</b> should remain separate from your unused dice and cannot be hidden. <!-- All unused dice can remain hidden from opponents. --></p>

<p><b>Reroll all</b> rolls that you get zero successes.</p>

<p><h2> Ability Checks</h2></p>

<p>When players want to perform a feat of some kind (out of combat), be it disarming a trap, kicking in a door, or piloting a ship, the GM decides the level of difficulty and rolls the number of action dice and/or skill dice necessary for the player to beat.  The player then rolls all their dice, including relevant vocation bonuses, and if they don't match or exceed the successes and skills of the GM's roll, they fail. ***Vocation bonuses*** are given at GM discretion reflecting the character's chosen vocation (usually 1 skill die and 1 proficiency die).</p>

<p><h2> More rules about Magic </h2>
Casting spells causes 1 exhaustion per total <img style="width: 10px" src="http://www.iconsdb.com/icons/preview/royal-blue/literature-xxl.png" /> used.  </p>

<p>Gemstones to store magic are rare, but available to casters.
Casters can store 1 + half their level <img style="width: 10px" src="http://www.iconsdb.com/icons/preview/royal-blue/literature-xxl.png" />'s worth per day into gemstones if they have at least 4 hours of down time in order to use it as a magic reserve and prevent exhaustion.</p>


</p>
<p><h2> Items</h2></p>

<p>Outside of combat, items are used freely.  During combat, you have to burn dice to use items, and counts as an action.
<b>Note:</b> Some items have minimum Str, Dex, or Int requirements to use, violating this prehibits use of proficiency dice.

<p> The rules found here are by no means all that one would need to play Starstream to it's fullest extent, though they are all that is necessary to play.  For great reference, listen to Maximum Fun's 'The Adventure Zone', with Magnus, Merle, and Taako, and listen to the One Shot Network's 'Campaign', with Trist, Bacta, and Leenik.  </p>
<p> These podcasted actual plays of D&D and Edge of the Empire exude the best type of improvisation and focus on the story along with excellently bringing the characters to life that tabletop gaming has to offer.  Neither lay the story at the altar of strict rules adherence, and that's the way it should be for a game.</p>

<p> The best thing you can do to bring your stories to life are to practice, practice, practice.  Play with people you know are hilarious, and don't feel embarassed to get into character.  Don't play a gimmick, play a person, who has feelings and different ways of dealing with things than you.</p>

<p> Final Note to GM's:  The more you say "No" to your players, the less fun they have (you don't exactly have to say "yes", either).</p>

<p> Final Note to players: Bring on the shenanigans, but remember, you aren't the one telling the story.  Play your character fun and seriously, just don't take yourself too seriously.</p>

                    <h3>Starstream</h3>
                    <p>Once upon a time tabletop RPGs were created.  They relied on dice and pen and paper for players to keep track of their statistics and equipment.  This created a barrier for new players because it was crazy intimidating, especially their first game.  Enter Starstream, where your character is entirely tracked with dice, combat is virtually real time, and strategy is more rewarded than high rolls.</p>
