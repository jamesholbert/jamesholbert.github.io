		<b>Councilman Baust:</b> While you haven't earned one of our more prestigious methods of travel, we do have... options.. for you. This is the Dimensional Lever. Attach it to any door and it will open a portal to a different relative version of <i>The Manor</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Long ago, there was an expiriment taken on a plane much like the etherial plane. You see, it was empty, and unused, and because nothing grew, it didn't seem to serve a purpose, so some erudite wizards took it upon themselves to try and make a quick means of travel by shrinking it, but leaving it fully in congruity with the material plane. There was, though, a side effect. The plane became.. sentient. And it doesn't like visitors. If you spend too long in there, it will cast an unstable type of magic on whoever resides in it. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Make your path quick. Each door in the Manor represents another in the material plane, but very few doors from the material plane will have a counterpart in the manor, so you will never end up <i> exactly</i> where you're looking to go, but it can be close. The distrance you travel is amplified a few hundren fold or so, it's never been an exact science. Make sure your orientation is in the right cardinal direction, and make a break for it. Good luck.

	<p>Roll 3d6.</p>

	<p>If doubles are rolled, roll a d20.</p>

	<p>If triples are rolled, roll 2d20 and both effects happen.</p>

	<p>For each character level, that number cannot be rolled, so roll again.</p>
