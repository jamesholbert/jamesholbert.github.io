<p>Roll 3d6.</p>

<p>If doubles are rolled, roll a d20.</p>

<p>If triples are rolled, roll 2d20 and both effects happen.  Once you hit level 10, roll (2)d10+10 instead.</p>


<p>For each character level, that number cannot be rolled, so roll again.</p>

19 you drop to zero hit points
18 you get a death save failure
16-17 your movement speed is halved
14-15 portal intoxication (you need to be healed by a cleric or visit the mansion again within a day or you die)
12-13 you are blinded
10-11 you lose 2 hit dice
8-10 nothing happens
6-7 your speed is doubled
4-6 you get portal immunity for 3 turns
1-3 roll again</p>
